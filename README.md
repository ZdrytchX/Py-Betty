INCOMPLETE. Will make a build/release when at least somewhat functional.

Basically will become Wt-Betty on Python, ideally for multi-OS compatability.

There *MAY* be some advanced systems be added too.

Goals:

* Read 8111indications (Done)

* Add read/save support for aircraft-specific configurations (somewhat done)

* Add warning functions (TODO)

* Add sound player to play said warnings(TODO, give me recommendations plz - must include a minimum of .wav playback, loop and stop, and multi-sound channel or simulteneous sound support)

* Add GUI. I'd rather avoid tkinter if possible. I hear Spyder is an option.

Other wishful goals:

* Autopilot for teh lulz. Take-off, land at same airfield, and bomb maybe. The bombing part requires the elevation of the target.

* AP Requires virtual joy input and a controller to smooth out input operations (otherwise I might be able to just do it from scratch with basic fuzzy logic? shrug)

* AP requires basic navigation

* As a result of basic aeronatucis, we can make a basic function for dead reckoning for VFR markerless flights. Not that we need any.

* AP rqeuires a comprehensive DB of strip spawns

* Tacview interpreter support

* Neural Network to play the game for you. I mean, why grind when you can just have an autopilot bomb for you! - lol

* Input dampening for shit like dynamically static stability spifires

* Proximity warning for RB/AB players. Will only work while they are spotted by the team though

* The power to convince gaijin to add complex systems to the game and that I'm not just a dumb client who knows nothing
